TranslateRenPy

Author: duc010298

## Features

- Unlimited number of characters to be translated
- Using selenium to translate (no need Yandex API key or Google Cloud Services - free for all)
- Automatically override available languages (you do not need renpy sdk to Generate Translations)
- Automatically ignores variables or special characters during translation:
    ### Example
    1. `[earnings]` is kept after translation
        ```
        # m "OK, let's check the school's account. The school's owners have transferred me [earnings] credits."
        m "OK, vérifions le compte de l'école. Les propriétaires de l'école m'ont transféré [earnings] crédits."
        ```
    2. `\n` (break line) is kept after translation
        ```
        old "Loading will lose unsaved progress.\nAre you sure you want to do this?"
        new "Le chargement perdra la progression non enregistrée.\nEs-tu sûr de vouloir faire ça?"
        ```
    3. `%s` is kept after translation
        ```
        old "Saved screenshot as %s."
        new ""
        ```
    And some other special cases

## Quick Start

### Installation instructions

1. Install Python

    You need Python 3 or later to run translate-renpy
    
    For Windows, packages are available at
    
    https://www.python.org/getit/

2. Install requirements

    Clone or download zip source code, open Command line in source code folder
    
    Install requirements using `pip`:
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install Driver

    You should instal Chrome browser and check your browser version
    
    And then download ChromeDriver suitable for your browser at: [chromedriver.chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
    
    After downloaded, extract it, copy and rewrite `chromedriver.exe` to folder `Driver` in source code folder

### Usage

1. First you need generate RenPy translations

    You can read and follow Generate RenPy translations section on this post: 
    
    [F95 RenPy Translation tool](https://f95zone.to/threads/renpy-translation-tool.21920/)

    ** Note: Some games do not compile rpyc files. If in the folder `[your_game]\game\tl\[language]` there are many files with .rpy extension look like on screen below, you can skip this step.

2. To open help menu, open command line in source code folder and run:

    `python trans-ren.py --help`
    
    Help menu may show look like below:
    
       usage: trans-ren.py [-h] [-v] -d <path> -i <language> -o <language> -t <number> [-sb]

       TransRen: Translate your Renpy game into any language

       optional arguments:
          -h, --help           show this help message and exit
          -v, --version        show version and exit.

       program arguments:
          -d <path>            directory path containing the .rpy file
          -i <language>        the language you want to translate from
          -o <language>        the language you want to translate into
          -t <number>          number of thread (many threads will take high CPU)
          -sb, --show-browser  show browser while translating (show browser windows can take high RAM)

       For more information, visit https://github.com/duc010298-1/translate-renpy

    `-d` For directory, this is directory of your transitions folder 
    
    `-i` `-o` For input language and output language, you should go to [cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages) and find `ISO-639-1 Code` of your language
    
    `-t` For number of thread, this is the number of browser tabs the tool will open simultaneously (I recommended 4 for 8Gb Ram)
    
    If you want to see the process live, you can add `-sb` (show browser) to your command
### Examples
    
- Transitions folder: `D:\Game\My_cute_roommate-1.6.1ex-win\game\tl\english`
- Language you want to translate from: `english`
- Language you want to translate into: `vietnamese`
- Command should use:

      python trans-ren.py -d "D:\Game\My_cute_roommate-1.6.1ex-win\game\tl\english" -i en -o vi -t 4 -sb

### Demo
In short, I deleted some files in the Transitions folder to make the translation faster
